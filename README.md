## About Mister Bloggy

I built this blog web application to be able to share the latest in music, food and design with my friends. Users can log in with Google Authetication and make posts or comment on posts by friends. On their account page, users can see all their posts and edit or delete their own posts.

## Frameworks

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
